/*
 * This is a streamlined Strongly-Connected Component finder for use with
 * procedurally generated or explored graphs, where the nodes and edges are not
 * known a priori.
 *
 * REQUIREMENTS
 *
 * The Node type must be copyable and have a suitable hash function.
 *
 * The user code must take the form of a Depth First Search which can be
 * repeatedly invoked on unvisited nodes until the whole graph has been
 * traversed.
 *
 * The user code must always follow edges to child nodes, even if it knows the
 * node has already been visited. The SCC finder needs to know about all edges.
 *
 * The user code must ensure that nodes are not re-examined once they have been
 * assigned to an SCC. The finder does not maintain any state for such nodes.
 *
 * GUARANTEES
 *
 * The SCC finder will ensure each node is examined exactly once.
 *
 * The SCCs will be presented in a topological order, leaves first.
 *
 * Note that within each SCC, nodes will be presented in DFS traversal order,
 * roots first. However, this is just an implementation detail, not a guarantee.
 *
 * USAGE
 *
 * Before examining a node, check it's not been assigned to an SCC already and
 * then call Open. If the node is already "open" (i.e., is already waiting to be
 * assigned to an SCC), this will return an empty optional value and the node
 * should not be examined. If Open succeeds, a numerical node handle will be
 * returned and the node will be recorded as waiting to be assigned to an SCC.
 *
 * Now examine the node, making recursive calls to follow edges to other nodes.
 * Information about the node can be stored provisionally, but must NOT be used
 * to make decisions about whether to revisit it - that is Open's job.
 *
 * Once the examination is done, call Close, passing in the handle. If the node
 * has been identified as the "root" of an SCC, the whole SCC will be returned
 * as a vector of nodes. If any processing needs to be done (such as recording
 * the nodes as visited), this should be done now. Otherwise, an empty vector
 * will be returned.
 *
 * After a top-level DFS has completed, the SCC finder should be carrying no
 * state. This can be verified by calling Empty.
